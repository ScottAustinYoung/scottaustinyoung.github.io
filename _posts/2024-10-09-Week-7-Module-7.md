# Welcome to Week 7's post!

---
For Module 7's work our class was given a lecture on regression analysis. In addition to the lecture, there was a helpful reading section on key terms that explains the topic easier, and in the context of R.  

The questions in which were posed to the class this week are as follows:

1.1 By using the lm() function I can demonstrate the relationship between the predictor variable X and the response variable Y.

Here I am simply defining the assigned vectors to x & y, then using those vectors within the lm() function to define a model variable.  
1.2 Now for calculating the coefficients it is simply completed through the summary() function. As shown below, the coefficients are roughly 19.206 for the intercept & 3.269 for the slope from this data.

2.1 For this question I have defined the two variables into a dataframe this time. The predictor variable in this case is "waiting", while the response variable is the "discharge."  
2.2 By using the coefficients function on the dataframe, it will extract the needed data by running the lm() function and only printing the coefficients. In this case it is an intercept of -1.53317418 & a slope of 0.06755757.  
2.3 Lastly, by estimating the "fit" of the discharge by using a waiting value of 80 and running it through the predict() function I was able to return a value of 3.871431.

I hope that in formatting the questions together in this case then providing the work below is a bit easier to read and follow along. Please if you're able to provide feedback on what would be easiest to read, then that would be helpful.

3.1 Printed below is a summary within RStudio of the Multi Regression model for the mtcars dataset. The model used for this question is in trying to discern each cars fuel efficiency. This is factored by the miles per gallon as our Y variable over the other three variables as our X. The intercept in this case does not lend itself for useful interpretation, as this is the value when the displacement, horsepower, and weight are at 0. As each of the three variables are negative, it means that as each value increases along our X range then the fuel efficiency decreases.

5.1 For this question, if the weight is measured at 70 kilograms then the metabolic rate is 1305.394. Below is a plotted graph of the initial data set of rmr, along with the work in RStudio to arrive at the metabolic rate for 70 kilograms.
