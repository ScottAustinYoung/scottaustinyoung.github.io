# Welcome to Week 8's post!

Our task this week was a module on the Analysis of Variance method known as ANOVA.
So, let's begin with the two questions.

By creating a data frame out of the above chart within the question it is possible to view detailed information on specific result attributes.

The Degrees of Freedom (DF) in this case represents that there are three separate groups being compared within the function.

The Sum Sq value represents in the question the variation in stress levels within singular groups of high, moderate, and low.   
The Mean Sq value represents the variation in stress levels between each group, which is found by dividing the sum sq by the degrees of freedom.  
The F value is a combination of sorts between sum sq and mean sq. By that, I mean that it is a value that shows there is a greater variation between groups compared to within the groups. In short, a ratio between groups.  
Lastly, the Pr(>F) is the p-value associated with this question. In this case, the p-value suggests that there are major differences between all three groups due to their means varying.  


Starting with the second question, we simply need to install and load in our necessary packages.  
Then, we have to perform t-tests comparing active to passive, then active to none and passive to none.

2.1: From these t-tests we can see that when comparing the active group to the passive group that "Active" training does not have a significant impact.  
In addition, when comparing active to none we have the same result as our p-value is greater than 0.05.  
Lastly, when comparing passive to none we cannont conclude that the "Passive" method has an impact when compared to the "None" group.  

For question 2.2 we are asked to produce a ANOVA test on the Zelazo dataset. In this example I used the stack function on the zelazo dataset. Here are the results of the ANOVA test.

As with the previous t-tests, the ANOVA test led to the same result. In that we must reject the null hypothesis as the p-value listed as 0.129 is much greater than the signifigance threshold of 0.05.
