# Welcome to Week 9's 2nd post!

As this is the 2nd post this week, let's go over what module 10 is all about. This module has us examining regression coefficients using ANOVA methods.  
Here are the following questions in which I'll answer below.

1. In the case of this question, the dependent variable is pemax. The variables of age, weight, blood pressure, fev1 are being used to see how it affects pemax. I will provide an analysis of blood pressure, the bmp variable.

In the results of the ANOVA test, the bmp variable has a significant effect on pemax, as it is over the threshold of 0.05 sitting at 0.0501483. This data tells us that there is a variable difference in pemax for indiviuduals with different blood pressures. As for a multivariate analysis of pemax with bmp, as age increases by 1 unit then the pemax variable increases by 2.49 and blood pressure decreses by -2.86. In addition, as weight increases then pemax and blood pressure also correlate positively. The intercept between pemax and bmp sits at 33.1313 pemax to 70.758 bmp. These are helpful measurements to dissect, as the pemax variable is representative of a persons Peak Expiratory Pressure. This is a measurement of a persons expiratory muscles and how strong they might be. By measuring a persons age with this model, you can asses whether or not they are within the average to detect respiratory diseases.

2. By creating three separate models and examining their summaries I can provide an analysis for question 2. When comparing the Multiple R-squared value for each model, the combined model explains the greatest variance in birth weight at 85.83%. Below I have included scatterplots to help illustrate the model fits. As you include both variables into the equation a more accurate and fully informed assessment is made.

I will be honest in admitting I had difficulty coming up with an analysis for this modules work, beyond looking at the variables themselves of course. I understand up to the fact that there are independent and dependent variables that affect one another, and you can measure those effects with values in summaries. But creating a meaningful analysis on what the values actually mean has been difficult.
