# Welcome to Week 10's post!

For this week's lecture our class has gone over material on logistic regression. Below are the questions posted for the class to answer on our respective blogs.

Question 1 has us set up a simple additive model using the ashina data from the ISwR package. By following the hints in the question, I created a model using the glm() function, then preformed a t-test comparing the active variable and placebo variable. Below is a screencapture of my console.

When comparing the treatment to the placebo following the summary of my model, we can see that there is a significant effect by looking at the residuals from the treat intercept.  
The t-tests compares the means of the vas score variable between the active and placebo groups. The signifigance level, or p-value, sits at a statistically significant level of 0.005644. This suggests that there is a large enough difference between the groups.

Question 2 asks to use the rnorm() method in creating the model matrices. After assigning the variables, I generated separate matrices before fitting them into a model to take a look at them.  
Below is the console for question 2, and you can see that I have fitted two models for z ~ a*b and z ~ a:b.

The most significant number I find that jumps out from these results is residual deviance for each model. Both have the same value! From this alone I can interpret that each model is equally suitable for fitting the assigned data. But I suspect this is due to both models using the same number of parameters and observations, regardless of the structure of the model. The second model I also suspect that it is more flexible in fitting the data, but is also more complex in how it iterates.
