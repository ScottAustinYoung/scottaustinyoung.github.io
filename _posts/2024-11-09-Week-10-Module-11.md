For this week's lecture our class has gone over material on logistic regression. Below are the questions posted for the class to answer on our respective blogs.

Question 1 has us set up a simple additive model using the ashina data from the ISwR package. By following the hints in the question, I created a model using the lm() function, then preformed a t-test comparing the active variable and placebo variable. Below is a screencapture of my console.

When comparing the treatment to the placebo following the summary of my model, we can see that there is a significant effect by looking at the residuals from the treat intercept.  
The t-tests compares the means of the vas score variable between the active and placebo groups. The signifigance level, or p-value, sits at a statistically significant level of 0.005644. This suggests that there is a large enough difference between the groups.

Question 2 asks to use the rnorm() method in creating the model matrices for models.
