# Welcome to Week 12's post!

---
This week the class was asked to construct a time series dataframe from a provided set. It consisted of 12 values per year, for 2 years.  
<br>
Once I created my time series I then was asked to create a forecast using the HoltWinters() function. Below are some screencaptures of my RStudio console.

Initially, in the data set I did not apply exponential smoothing towards the data by adding the correct arguments of beta = FALSE and gamma = FALSE.
<br>
I revised this within the second image with a newly stored data forecast.  
<br>
Now for the associated plots. 
<br>
I wanted to convey the effect of applying exponential smoothing with a before and after of plots with the data.
<br>  
The third plot is using the forecast() function with a time variable of h = 48. I used a variable of 48 time instances, as this forecasts an additional 4 years.

<br>
My interpretation of the model is that it is working off of a single exponentially smoothed variable that does not react or account for trends. The data exists in a vaccum of our provided dataset.

<br>
As such, it is a relatively stable model with a high alpha of 0.8232442. For fun I thought to include the third plot that shows a visual forecast of how the data might be extrapolated over 4 extra years.

<br>
As it stands with the forecast, the charges value on a students credit card could potentially be as high as 181 by December of 2017.
<br>
Lastly, when evaluating our forecast within the data provided in plot #2, the forecast when compared to the smoothed data is fairly agreeable with a good fit.
